The "Pokemon Tile Mapper" project is a Python-based image processing tool designed to analyze grid-based map images from games or similar applications. It identifies and maps out specific tiles that are filled with a designated color—in this case, white—against a predefined tile size, which is 16x16 pixels by default.

The tool systematically scans through the image, tile by tile, utilizing the NumPy library to process pixel data efficiently. It employs a color thresholding technique to detect white tiles, which can be configured to adjust the sensitivity of the detection algorithm. This flexibility allows for the accommodation of various shades and degrees of the target color, ensuring that even tiles with slight variations from pure white can be detected.

The primary output of "WhiteTileMapper" is a list of coordinates, each corresponding to the top-left corner of a white tile within the grid. This list is crucial for game developers, level designers, or cartographers who need to programmatically identify walkable versus non-walkable areas, or to analyze and modify map layouts based on certain color-coded criteria.

Additionally, the project includes functionality to compare the detected tile coordinates against a set of expected coordinates, allowing for validation and quality assurance of the tile mapping process. The tool can be easily adapted to detect tiles of different colors or to work with various image and grid sizes, making it a versatile solution for a range of image analysis tasks in game development and beyond.
